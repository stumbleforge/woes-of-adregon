## **About**

I used to play Old School RuneScape a _lot_ as a kid, returned to the game as an adult, and was disappointed. My two biggest frustrations were horrendous drop rates with lackluster pity systems, and the amount of time needed to advance in the game. As an adult, it just wasn't feasible for me to play, but the hours-long melody of dull wooden knocks is irresistible to my lizard brain... And thus, the desire to create something to scratch that Woodcutting itch was born. For now, I'm starting with a small demo to cut trees, which is what this repository currently hosts. I'm not sure how far this will go, but if it ends up being developed into the fully-fledged game I can envision, that'd be dope.
